This folder is a collection of Julia scripts that demonstrate how to use `Recommendation.jl` as part of end-to-end recommender systems development, including data loading, training, prediction, and evaluation.

In particular, `benchmark.jl` examines as much recommender-metric combinations as possible to compare their performance.

```sh
julia --threads auto -- benchmark.jl
```
