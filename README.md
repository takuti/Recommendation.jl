**Recommendation.jl** is a minimal, customizable Julia package for building recommender systems. Pre-built basic functionalities include:

- Non-personalized baselines that give unsophisticated, rule-based recommendation.
- Collaborative filtering on either explicit or implicit user-item matrix.
- Content-based filtering by using the TF-IDF weighting technique.
- Evaluation based on a variety of rating and ranking metrics, with easy-to-use N-fold cross validation executor.

## Installation

```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("Recommendation")
```

## Usage

This package contains `DataAccessor` and several fundamental recommendation techniques (e.g., non-personalized `MostPopular` recommender, `CF` and `MF`), and evaluation metrics such as `Recall`:

All of them can be accessible by loading the package as follows:

```julia
using Recommendation
```

First of all, you need to create a data accessor from a matrix:

```julia
using SparseArrays

data = DataAccessor(sparse([1 0 0; 4 5 0]))
```

or set of events:

```julia
n_user, n_item = 5, 10

events = [Event(1, 2, 1), Event(3, 2, 1), Event(2, 6, 4)]

data = DataAccessor(events, n_user, n_item)
```

where `Event()` is a composite type which represents a user-item interaction:

```julia
type Event
    user::Int
    item::Int
    value::Float64
end
```

Next, you can pass the data accessor to an arbitrary recommender as:

```julia
recommender = MostPopular(data)
```

and building a recommendation engine should be easy:

```julia
build!(recommender)
```

Personalized recommenders sometimes require us to specify the hyperparameters:

```julia
help?> Recommendation.MF
  MF(
      data::DataAccessor,
      k::Int
  )
```

```julia
recommender = MF(data, 2)
build!(recommender, learning_rate=15e-4, max_iter=100)
```

Once a recommendation engine has been built successfully, top-`2` recommendation for a user `4` is performed as follows:

```julia
# for user#4, pick top-2 from all items
recommend(recommender, 4, 2, collect(1:n_item))
```

See [**documentation**](https://takuti.github.io/Recommendation.jl/latest/) for the details.
